# Advanced Tips

This page will cover points that do not fit in other parts of this document. More tips may be added over time.

### Problem: Can I change the order in Score Input Sheet?
Yes, you can. Changing the order on <score-input-sheet /> will generally not affect the order in <regular-score-list />.  

Note that for different versions (Scores in Same Name), if you change the order, it **will** affect the final version order. You can change Version Order on ScoreList to your likings, but you should change placement to match that order.

### Problem: There is more than one circles in `STATUS|MARKING`? There are empty circles when the score is in Storage?
Someone must have forgotten to take out the circles. Normally, you should take out all but one circle, indicating the score is taken at the moment. If you are sure the score is in Storage, take out all circles instead.

### Problem: I marked so many notes on Hard-copy. Can I take it home for Google Sheet input on my computer?
Yes, you can take home the Hard-copy as long as you soon return either the current Hard-copy or a new Hard-copy. You should print a new Hard-copy if you decide the current one is too outdated or messy with notes.

### Problem: The first item of a box is taken out. Should I change the `First Item Box Code`?
No, unless that item is [declared missing](./general-management#declare-missing). In that case, it is optional to move the First Item Box Code to an existing Item. If the change can flag an error, do not make that change.

### Problem: Can I change the order in Special Score List?
<p>Both <technical-papers /> and <oversized-scores /> have no rule to their orders. However, the order on ScoreList MUST reflect the placement in Physical Storage.</p>

So, you CAN change the order to your likings, but you should change the ScoreList and placement altogether.

### Problem: The SP Box is full. What should I do?
Add boxes with code SP#2, SP#3, SP#4 and so on, following the same rule in <regular-scores />. Because there are not many scores in these boxes, there is no need to record the Box Code on ScoreList.
