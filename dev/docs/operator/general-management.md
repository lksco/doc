## Print ScoreList
::: warning TIP
Printing is an important routine job for Operators. At least once every 2 months, you should check if there are any changes and if so, print the ScoreList.  

If you have trouble printing, ask another person or your Music Teacher for help. Send them this section. ([Copy this Link](#print-scorelist))  
:::

Every time you print, print <regular-score-list /> **and then** <special-score-list />.  
1. Go to [ScoreList](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V9uz-5N4GwmD1HQnuxjBj8iRKLUyiTaKfq2_NeQBZmo/edit?usp=sharing) and the Sheet you need to print
2. Go to Print Settings
    * More Options Button >> Share and Export >> Print (Mobile) or Ctrl+P (PC)
3. Configure the Following (PC only):
    * Print: Current Sheet
    * Scale: Fit to Width
    * Page Orientation: Portrait
    * Margins: Narrow
    * Under Formatting:  
    Check Show Grid Lines  
    Uncheck Show Notes
    * Under Headers and Footers:  
    Check Page Numbers, Current Date, Repeat Frozen Rows
    * After that, Click Next
4. Print the Page (Mobile & PC):
    * Page Range: Range of 1 **up to the Last Page with Content**
    > Example: 1-10, if page 11+ are empty
    * Two-sided: Flip on Long Edge

After printing **both** sheets as the new Hard-copy, swap it with the existing Hard-copy:
1. Bring the new Hard-copy to Storeroom
2. For any **useful** notes on `STATUS|REMARKS` column of the existing Hard-copy, handwrite them on the new Hard-copy
    
    > #### Useful or Useless?
    > Notes are usually **~~crossed out~~** when they become useless.  
    > Ticked circles NEED NOT to be copied, but empty circles NEED to be copied.  
    > Usually, Operators are able to determine if a note is useful or useless.  

3. Put the new Hard-copy in place and remove the existing Hard-copy  

## More about Score Status
In Score Management, it is important to trace scores and record their status correctly.  

### Add/Remove Status

#### Add Status
Operators can put **any words** in `STATUS|MARKING` for Volatile Score Status, and in `Remarks` for Lasting Score Status.  

* For `STATUS|MARKING`, **write on Hard-copy**. Any other notes can also be written to this column  
* For `Remarks`, **modify on Google Sheets**  

Operators can decide if a status is Volatile or Lasting.  

#### Retract Status or Remove Notes
To Retract a Volatile Score Status or Remove a Note, **~~cross it out~~** on `STATUS|MARKING`.  
To Retract a Lasting Score Status, **remove** it from `Remarks`.  

### Other Important Actions

#### Borrowed Status
Circle Marking is a type of Volatile Score Status, already explained in previous sections. This is the summary:
| Process | Status Referred | Action |
| ------- | --------------- | ------ |
| Standard Take-Out | 'Borrowed' | Mark a circle ◯ in `STATUS|MARKING` |
| Standard Put-In | 'Returned' | Put a tick ✓ in empty circle in `STATUS|MARKING` if there exists one |

#### Declare Missing
'Missing' is the most common Lasting Status in ScoreList.  

What counts as **apparently missing**:
* The Score is not marked with an empty circle or 'Missing', or
* The Score is marked with an empty circle for **more than 4 months**,

but you do not know where the score is.  

If a Score/Category **appears missing**, you should:
* Search the Storeroom Area  
* Ask your Music Teacher if they know the whereabout of the Score; Remember to follow-up with the Teacher  

If you still cannot find the Score, the Score can be **declared missing**:
* Find the Item in <regular-score-list /> or <special-score-list />  
* Append the word 'Missing' in `Remarks`  

If your Music Teacher or someone else is keeping the Score:
* Mark an empty circle in `STATUS|MARKING`  

::: tip
It may be tempting, but for any missing scores, you SHOULD NOT set `Folders` to `0` or Remove Score. Instead, declare missing and leave all other cells in its original value.

## Overall Checking
If there are too much inaccuracies on the ScoreList or the Physical Storage (i.e. Too many items are missing or mistakenly placed), it is recommended to do an Overall Checking:
1. You will need the Hard-copy and a pencil
2. For **each and every box**, check each Item:
    * If the correct number of folders of that Item exist, put a tick on that Item on Hard-copy
    * If the wrong number of folders are found, put a tick and mark the number of folders currently in box
    * If the Item does not exist, do not tick
3. If there is any misplaced scores, place them back to the right box and position using Standard Put In
4. After going through all boxes, conclude the status of Scores:
    * If the Score is ticked:  
      * Remove empty circles or 'Missing' remark on ScoreList
    * If the Score has the wrong Folder Count:  
      * Modify the Folder Count on ScoreList
    * If the Score is not present **and without** an empty circle or 'Missing' remark:  
      * Follow [Declare Missing](#declare-missing)
5. Follow [Print ScoreList](#print-scorelist) and replace the Hard-copy

This is a long process that would take over 5 hours if done by one person, and is recommended to be performed only when necessary.  

As the process involves a lot of Scores, Operators should have enough understanding of the System before performing Overall Checking. Each step should be carefully performed to ensure absolute accuracy in placement and the ScoreList record.
