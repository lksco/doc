# People and Development

[[toc]]

## Credits
Thanks to our music teacher and orchestra supervisor Miss KM Wong for the support and approval of this new system.

## Support
#### System Manager  
Please use the email provided to contact Oscar, the developer/system manager of LKSCO Scorelist. Questions and issues regarding the system or documentation is welcomed. Response time should be within one week.  
**Email:** [lksco@protonmail.com](mailto://lksco@protonmail.com)  

## Continuous Development
The ScoreList is expected to remain as-is unless users prompt fixes or upgrade. Further development with Google API may be considered, although unlikely to happen. Such system would allow Operators to modify data without learning Google Sheets.  

If you are interested in part-taking in the development or even provide another implementation or revision to the system, you are welcome to discuss with System Manager. (Contact information above)  

#### Contribute
We welcome all people to change the ScoreList and create their own experience. This section is for people who want to contribute to the project.
