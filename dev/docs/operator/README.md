# Introduction
This document will provide a comprehensive guide to the operations on ScoreList and the physical Score Storage that Operators need to know.

[[toc]]

## Prerequisites
* A Google Account - If you do not have one, please register [here](https://accounts.google.com)
* The Google Sheets App (Mobile) or Browser (PC)
* Permission to view/edit the ScoreList from an administrator

::: tip
The administrator is usually your music teacher.  
You should provide them your Google E-mail Address.  
Once they add you into the document, you will be able to edit the file.
:::

## Getting Started
* Open the [ScoreList](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V9uz-5N4GwmD1HQnuxjBj8iRKLUyiTaKfq2_NeQBZmo/edit?usp=sharing) for the first time
* Next time, go directly to the Google Sheets App (Mobile) or [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets) (PC); `LKSCO - ScoreList` should be among your list of recent documents

::: tip If Google Sheets indicates `View only` in the document
![View Only](/doc/assets/img/view-only.png)  
It means you cannot edit the Spreadsheet. This is what you can do:  
* If you are a Score Manager (Operator),  
  * check that you are on the correct account; or  
  * contact an administrator about your problem
* If you are not an Operator or an Administrator, editing is not allowed

## Routine
Score management routines are as follows.  
#### Follow Up Requests from Teacher
![Per Request](https://img.shields.io/badge/Per-Request-important?style=for-the-badge)  
Your music teacher may ask you to add a new score to the ScoreList, or take scores from the Storeroom.  
#### Score Management
![Every Month](https://img.shields.io/badge/Once%20(or%20more)%20per-1%20month-yellow?style=for-the-badge)  
Set up a collection point and let people return scores there. Check and store any accumulated scores into the boxes.  
#### Maintain a Hard-copy
![Every 2 Months or More Frequently](https://img.shields.io/badge/Once%20(or%20more)%20per-2%20months-yellowgreen?style=for-the-badge)  
If there are any changes to the <regular-score-list /> or <special-score-list />, print and swap out the storeroom copy of the ScoreList.  
#### Inspect and Maintain Scores and Catalogue
![If Outdated](https://img.shields.io/badge/If-Outdated-critical?style=for-the-badge)  
If the catalogue is too outdated or flawed, perform an Overall Check on the whole storage against the catalogue and update the information. Request for new boxes from the teacher and replace the damaged ones. Discuss with the teacher about the possibility of using bookshelves for future storage or any other favourable upgrade for easier operation.  
#### Suggest Updates
![If Outdated](https://img.shields.io/badge/If-Outdated-critical?style=for-the-badge)  
Report any outdated information on the documentation to System Manager. Suggest updates to the ScoreList System if needed.

More instructions to routines are provided on the General Management page.

## Site Protection
To prevent ScoreList from being griefed or falsely manipulated:
#### Version History
* Google Sheets provides a `Version History` that saves a copy periodically
* In case of a site problem, the Operator can decide whether and which version to rollback
#### Backup Storage
* The official backup storage is maintained and updated **twice a month** by System Manager. [Access Link Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_fp5PVgriJ9VGYI0rtV-D4Elmc4CJ_fZ?usp=sharing)
* If necessary, please ask System Manager for a rollback to one of these versions
#### Create a Copy
* Operators can duplicate and keep their own copy
  * In Google Sheets, use `Share and Export` > `Make a Copy`(Mobile) or `File` > `Make a Copy`(PC)
  * Alternatively, use `File` > `Download` to create a local copy on your device (PC)
* Operators **should not** rollback to their own copy, unless absolutely necessary, in case of any error  

::: danger Do not abuse rollback
Most problems can be solved without a rollback. It is generally adviced not to test anything potentially harmful on the currently active ScoreList.
